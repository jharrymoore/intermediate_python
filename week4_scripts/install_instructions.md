## Instructions for getting set up with PyCharm and python on a Windows machine

* Find and install both PyCharm Community Edition and Python from the AZ software store, this should the software for you.

* When you go through the Python installer, make sure the 'Add Python to PATH' box is checked.  This will allow you to call the python executable without specifying its full path from the command line

That's it! Make sure you can launch PyCharm and you'll be ready to go on Thursday!
