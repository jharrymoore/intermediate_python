# Intermediate Python

Schedule:

* Week 1: Introduction to Numpy 
* Week 2: Deep-dive into Pandas
* Week 3: Matplotlib and seaborn - creating publication standard figures (different types of plots, colour schemes, subplots, exporting)  
* Week 4: Writing command line programs - introudction to IDEs  
* Week 5-8: End-2-end ML project
    * Week 6: Introduction to a standard ML pipeline
    * Week 7: build an ML pipeline and training models using sklearn (e.g logistic regression, random forest)  
    * Week 8: build an application to visualise and interact with your machine learning models 


Technical Notes
  
  * We will start in jupyter notebooks run in colab instances, however we will transfer over to working on local machines in week 4 when we start writing standalone python scripts.  For this you will need to install both python3.9 and pycharm community edition from the AZ software store.  Prior to the fourth session, we will release some more detailed instructions for getting set up to use Python on your own machines (primarily so you are in a position to work with your own data), and will run a drop in session to iron out any technical issues you might encounter.
